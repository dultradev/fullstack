I am **Rian Albert dos Santos Dultra**, a Computer Engineering student at SENAI CIMATEC and currently a research fellow at ISI-SAS (SENAI Institute for Advanced Health Systems).

My work blends context analysis, solution design, and software development to reduce manual operations and make workflows more dynamic.

My strongest technical foundation is **Python**, with practical experience in **TypeScript, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL**, plus API integration, database architecture, and applied AI in real-world solutions.

My career goal is to pursue continuous learning and become a professional capable of designing robust, scalable, and effective software architectures.

I aim to deliver not the most generic solution, but the solution that best fits the real problem, respecting technical, operational, and business constraints.

I also want to expand my impact in tech communities by mentoring people and accelerating access to market-relevant cloud and software skills.
